=head1 NAME

PDF::Imposition::Schema2down - Imposition schema 2down (booklet with binding on the top)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class inherit everything from L<PDF::Imposition::Schema2up> and
only alters the C<impose> method to rotate the pages by 90 degrees.
Please refer to the parent class for method documentation.

=head1 SCHEMA EXPLANATION

First go and read the schema explanation in
L<PDF::Imposition::Schema2up> (or better, the whole documentation).
It's the same dynamic kind of imposition.

The only difference is that each I<logical> page is rotated by 90
degrees counter-clockwise, so a signature of 4 pages looks so:

        +------+------+   +------+------+   
        |   4  |  1   |   |   2  |  3   |   
        +------+------+   +------+------+   

Now, showing the number rotated by 90 degrees is a bit complicated in
ASCII-art, but each logical page is B<rotated counter-clockwise>, so
you have to bind it on the short edge (and the final product will look
much more like a notepad than a booklet, as the binding will fall on
the top edge).

I find this schema odd, but I provide it nevertheless.
