=head1 NAME

PDF::Imposition - Perl module to manage the PDF imposition

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.21

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.21';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is meant to simplify the so-called imposition, i.e.,
rearrange the pages of a PDF to get it ready to be printed and folded,
with more logical pages placed on the sheet, usually (but not
exclusively) on recto and verso.

This is what the routine looks like:

    use PDF::Imposition;
    my $imposer = PDF::Imposition->new(file => "test.pdf",
                                       outfile => "out.pdf",
                                       # or # suffix => "-imposed",
                                       signature => "40-80",
                                       cover => 0,
                                       schema => "2up");
    $imposer->impose;
    print "Output left in " . $imposer->outfile;


Please note that you don't pass the PDF dimensions (which are
extracted from the source PDF itself by the class, using the very
first page: if you want imposition, I do the reasonable assumption you
have all the pages with the same dimensions).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Costructor options and accessors

=head3 file

The input file

=head3 outfile

The output file

=head3 suffix

The suffix of the output file (don't mix the two options).

=head3 schema

The schema to use.

=back

=head3 cover

If the last logical page must be placed at the very end, B<after> the
blank pages used to pad the signature. (C<2up>, C<2down>
C<1x4x2cutfoldbind>, C<4up>, C<1x1> only).

Often it happens that we want the last page of the pdf to be the last
one on the physical booklet after folding. If C<cover> is set to a
true value, the last page of the logical pdf will be placed on the
last page of the last signature.

=head3 signature

The signature (integer multiple of four or range): C<2up> and C<2down> only.

=head3 paper

Passing this option triggers the cropmarks. While the original
dimensions are left unchanged, this size represents the size of the
logical page which is actually imposed.

For example, you have a PDF in a6, you pass C<a5> as paper, and schema
C<2up>, you are going to get an a4 with 2 a6 with cropmarks.

This option is passed to L<PDF::Cropmarks>. See the module
documentation for the accepted values.

This feature is marked as B<experimental>.

=head3 paper_thickness

This option is passed to L<PDF::Cropmarks>. See the module
documentation for the accepted values.

=head3 title

The title to set in the PDF meta information. Defaults to the basename.

=head2 impose

Main method which does the actual job. You have to call this to get
your file. It returns the output filename.

The names of schemas are taken straight from the ConTeXt ones (if
existing), as described in the book I<Layouts in context>, by Willi
Egger, Hans Hagen and Taco Hoekwater, 2011.

=back

=head1 TODO

The idea is to provide a wide range of imposition schemas (at least
the same provided by ConTeXt). This could require some time. If you
want to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and send a pull
request or a patch (please include documentation and at some tests).
